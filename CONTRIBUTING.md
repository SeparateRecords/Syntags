# Contributing to Syntags

Contributions are welcome! I'd appreciate it if you open an issue to discuss the
proposed changes first, but I'm also happy for that discussion to take place in
a pull request.

Some details below.

Keeping the namespaces updated with the living spec is important. Pull requests
to add new elements in the WHATWG HTML standard are welcome, feel free to submit
without a prior issue.
